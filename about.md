I'm a computer science student at [Bilkent University](https://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/), Turkey. I am currently working on [Flavorsion](https://www.flavorsion.com/) ðŸ¤« and on some small personal projects. Next year, I'll probably be either in Canada or Europe doing my Master's and I'll be open to working opportunities. If you'd like, you can view my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/baykam-say/) profile or download my [resume](/assets/docs/Baykam_Say_Resume.pdf). If you are just here to get to know me or have a chat, you can follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BaykamSay).

You can contact me at email@email.com.
